# React Fundamentals
**Length****:** 2 hours
**Prerequisites:**
React is a JavaScript library, and so it assumes you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don't feel very confident, we recommend [refreshing your JavaScript knowledge](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) so you can follow along more easily.

We'll also be using some of the ES6 syntax in the examples. We try to use it sparingly because it's still relatively new, but we encourage you to get familiar with arrow functions, classes, template literals, let, and const statements: https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/

**Install Creact-react-app**
We'll be using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/) to build our application. Create React App is a command-line tool for rapidly bootstrapping React applications, with zero configuration needed.

It needs Node v6.x.x or greater installed on your machine. You can easily double check this by running `node --version` from the command line.

From your terminal, run the following command to install it globally:

    npm install -g create-react-app

To make sure it's working properly, try running:

    create-react-app react-workshop-app
    cd react-workshop-app
    npm start


## Syllabus

**Introduction**
First, we'll take a trip down memory lane to shine a light on some of the challenges that React was designed to solve.

React is a "declarative" library for building user interfaces. What does that mean, and what is imperative code? We'll answer these questions and explore the benefits that come from shifting imperative code into declarative components.

Not every project may need to use React, we'll look at few factors that might make a project a good candidate to use React.

**Rendering in React**
We'll explore the lowest level of React: rendering UI.
We'll take a look at what the "Virtual DOM" and JSX are, brush up on some JavaScript array methods, and do our first coding exercise.

Objectives:

- Render UI with React
- Become familiar with JSX
- Transform and massage data into UI

**Components**

- How to define components
- Props
- State
- (Styling components) ?

**Props vs. State**
One of the first questions that's likely to come up when you start using React is "when should I use state, and when should I use props?" We'll discuss how data flows, or rather, how components communicate with each other. Finally, we'll explore how component composition helps answer the "props vs. state" question.
