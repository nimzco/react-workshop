# React Fundamentals

### Length: 2 hours

## Prerequisites

### React
React is a JavaScript library, so it assumes you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don't feel very confident, we recommend [refreshing your JavaScript knowledge](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript).

### ES6
This workshop uses ES6 syntax in the examples. It is used sparingly, but we encourage you to get familiar with [arrow functions, classes, template literals, let, and const statements](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/)

### `creact-react-app`
The workshop uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/) to build our application. Create React App is a command-line tool for rapidly bootstrapping React applications, with zero configuration needed.

It needs Node v6.x.x or greater installed on your machine. You can easily double check this by running `node --version` from the command line.

From your terminal, run the following command to install it globally:
```sh
npm install -g create-react-app
```

To make sure it's working properly, try running:

```sh
create-react-app react-workshop-app
cd react-workshop-app
npm start
```

## Syllabus

### Introduction

First, we'll take a trip down memory lane to shine a light on some of the challenges that React was designed to solve.

React is a "declarative" library for building user interfaces. What does that mean, and what is imperative code? We'll answer these questions and explore the benefits that come from shifting imperative code into declarative components.

Not every project may need to use React, we'll look at few factors that might make a project a good candidate to use React.

### Rendering in React

We'll explore the lowest level of React: rendering UI.
We'll take a look at what the "Virtual DOM" and JSX are, brush up on some JavaScript array methods, and do our first coding exercise.

Objectives:

- Render UI with React
- Become familiar with JSX

### Components

Objectives:

- How to define components
- Learn about props
- Styling components

### Stateful Components

This chapter introduces how to store a state inside a components. I discusses how data flows and how components communicate with each other. Finally, it explores component composition and how it help choose between props or state.
