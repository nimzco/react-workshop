# Components
Everything in React starts with a component. A component takes in parameters, called ***props***, and returns a hierarchy of views to display.

> Components let you split an application's UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
>
> Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions.
> They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
