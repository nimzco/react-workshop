# Components
Everything in React starts with a component.

> Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
>
> Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions.
> They accept arbitrary inputs (called ‚Äúprops‚Äù) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

## Creating a component

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function that returns JSX:

```js
function Title() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  );
}
```

We can then render our Title component in our application:

```
<Title />
```

As it stands, our Title component isn't very re-usable, since it will always return 'Hello World' as its value.

## Passing data to our component
To create components that are generic and re-usable, we'll need to be able to pass them attributes.

### Specifying attributes with JSX

Much like we do in HTML, passing data to our components is as easy as writing attributes (called ***Props*** in React) on these HTML-like tags:

```js
<Title value="üêØ Emoji Picker üê¨" />
```

Functional components receive a `props` parameter, which contains all the attributes passed to them.

We'll need to slightly update our previous example to read the `value` attribute from it's props:

```js
function Title(props) {
  return (
    <h1>{props.value}</h1>
  );
}
```

### Prop Types

Props can be any valid JavaScript expression:

- String
- Number
- Array
- Object
- Function

They can also span on multiple lines for easier readability.

Here's an example using a combindation of different expressions:

```js
<ProductList
  products={[
    {name: 'Leather Wallet', price: 40},
    {name: 'Fidget Spinner', price: 10},
    {name: 'Hoverboard', price: 999},
  ]}
  onProductSelect={function(product) {
    console.log(product);
  }}
  limit={10}
/>
```
*Note: As you may have noticed, Numbers, Arrays, Objects, and Functions must be wrapped within curly braces.*
